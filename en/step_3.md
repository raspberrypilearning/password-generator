## Step 4: Choosing a password length

Some websites require passwords to be a certain length. Let's allow the user to choose the length of their password.



+ First, ask the user to input a password length, and store it in a variable called `length`.

+ Use `int()` to turn the user's input into a whole number.

+ Use your `length` variable to repeat as many times as the user entered.

+ Test your code. The password created should be the length entered by the user.

## Step 5: Lots of passwords

Let's allow the user to create 3 passwords at once.



+ Add this code to create 3 passwords:

+ Highlight the code for creating a password, and press tab to indent so that it repeats 3 times.
