## Challenge: Using numbers and punctuation
Can you improve your program, so that it also chooses from:

+ Capital letters (A-Z)
+ Numbers (0-9)
+ Punctuation (!?.,-)

You'll need to add to your `chars` variable. Remember to test your improved program!



## Step 3: A random password

A single character isn't very useful - let's improve your program to create a longer password.



+ To create a password, you will add random characters to it, one at a time.

	To start with, your `password` variable should be empty. Add this line to your code:

+ You want to choose a random character 10 times. To do this, add the following code:

+ You should also indent (move in) the line to choose a random character, so that it happens 10 times.

	To indent, press the 'tab' key.

+ You need to use `+=` to __add__ the new character to the password each time.

+ Test your new code and you should see a password that's 10 characters long.
