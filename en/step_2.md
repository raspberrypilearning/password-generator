	There are some reasons why "letmein" isn't a good password to use:

	+ It's a very __common__ password (one of the 15 most used passwords). A computer would guess these first.

	+ It contains words from the __dictionary__. A computer would also try these passwords first.

	+ It's very __short__. It would take a computer more time to guess a longer password.

	+ It only contains __letters__. Passwords are more secure if they also contain numbers and punctuation.

+ Try entering a dictionary word. How long would it take a computer to guess that password?
