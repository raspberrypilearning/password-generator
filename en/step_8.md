## Choosing a password length

Some websites require passwords to be a certain length. Let's allow the user to choose the length of their password.



+ First, ask the user to input a password length, and store it in a variable called `length`.

+ Use `int()` to turn the user's input into a whole number.

+ Use your `length` variable to repeat as many times as the user entered.
