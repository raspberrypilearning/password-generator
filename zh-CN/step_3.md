Remember that your password is harder to guess if it's:

+ Long
+ Not a word in the dictionary
+ Contains letters, numbers and punctuation

You're going to generate passwords that are hard for a computer to crack. These are useful for protecting important accounts. Note that many adults use a password manager program to help them remember lots of tricky passwords.
