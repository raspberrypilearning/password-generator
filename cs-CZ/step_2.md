Type in "letmein" (Let me in) as the password. You'll see that a computer would guess this password extremely quickly!

There are some reasons why 'letmein' is a bad password to use:

+ It's a very __common__ password (one of the 15 most used passwords). A computer would guess these first.

+ It contains words from the __dictionary__. A computer would also try these passwords first.

+ It's very __short__. It would take a computer more time to guess a longer password.

+ It only contains __letters__. Passwords are more secure if they also contain numbers and punctuation.
